mandelbrot set explorer, has some limitations due and doesnt perform well tbh, but tuning the pixel skipping up will drastically increase the performance if you are have responsiveness troubles (which can always be dialed up again), 
my initial goal was to let it zoom in infinitely but that was a naive goal that isnt quite possible using javascript but this has a decent amount of zoom available.
